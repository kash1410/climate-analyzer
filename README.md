# CLIMATE DATA ANALYSIS : 
 
● Climate data analysis is the most fundamental step in 
predicting the climate change.  
● It helps to specify the climate of a specific location or region, 
such as precipitation, temperature, wind speed and humidity. 
● They are empirical studies conducted on the climate data, 
diagnostic analyses and mathematical data modeling.

# HOW IT WORKS 

1). IMPORTING LIBRARIES: First we import libraries to perform specific operations 
in our program further. 
2). READING DATA: With the help of Pandas library we read the CSV and using 
describe() and info() we come to know complete information of data. 
3). PLOTTING GRAPHS ON VARIOUS PARAMETERS: Using    matplotlib.pyplot and 
running a for loop we plot the graphs of various parameters showing their 
variations each day 
4). INDEX COLUMN: In this we replace the column showing index values with the 
date column. 
5). ADDING DAY,MONTH & HOUR COLUMNS: To make data more informative we 
add columns (with respect to date column)  showing the number of hours in the ‘ 
hour’ column, labeling each day in ‘day’ column, and each month in the ‘month’ 
column. 
6). USING LINEAR REGRESSION: It used to solve regression problems. Applying 
LinearRegression() we predict the test and find out score, R2 score and mean 
absolute error. 
10). KNN: It is most basic yet essential classification algorithms in ML. Using 
KNeighborsRegressor() we again calculate the score and we find that it is better 
than the previous score. 
11). RANDOM FOREST: It can be used for both Classification and Regression 
problems in ML. Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision 
trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the 
predictive accuracy of that dataset 
12). CNN: A convolutional neural network  is a network architecture for deep 
learning that learns directly from data. CNNs are particularly useful for finding 
patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories. For this we need 
to import Tensorflow and then keras.
